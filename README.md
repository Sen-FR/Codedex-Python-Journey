#Hi, I’m pretty new to coding. 01/26/26
I’ve always loved computers since I was a child, so I knew from a really young age that computers were my future. 
I’m 8 months away from going to college, but I still never learned Python or any kind of programming language besides CSS and HTML when I was in middle school.
I love logic and puzzles, even though I kind of suck. I like chess as well, even though I suck too. I wish to be a successful software engineer one day. Greetings from Mexico!
